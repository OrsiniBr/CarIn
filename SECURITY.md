If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us as soon as possible. We appreciate your efforts to disclose your findings responsibly.

To report a vulnerability, please email us at [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com). We will acknowledge your email within 48 hours and will work with you to resolve the issue.

We kindly ask you not to disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it. We will do our best to resolve the issue as quickly as possible and will keep you updated on our progress.
